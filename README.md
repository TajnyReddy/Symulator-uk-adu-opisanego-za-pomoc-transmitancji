# System Dynamics Simulation Tool
### Overview
This project is a System Dynamics Simulation Tool implemented in Python using PySide6 for the GUI and Matplotlib for plotting. It allows users to simulate and visualize the response of a dynamic system to different input signals.

### Features
* Three types of input signals: Harmonic, Rectangular, and Triangular.
* System dynamics simulation using numerical integration.
* Visualization of input and output signals.
